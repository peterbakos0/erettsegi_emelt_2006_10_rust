ERETTSEGI EMELT 2006 10 RUST
My Rust solution for the programming exercise in the 2006 oktober hungarian graduation exam.

Why does this exist?
I was super bored and wanted to try out one of the programming exercises the hungarian graduation exam has to offer.
This was also a great opportunity for me to practice and improve upon my Rust skills!

My experience
Compared to Advent of Code, I think it was more boring since it only covered very basic algorithms.
